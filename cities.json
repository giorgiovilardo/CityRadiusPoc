Then there’s the food, the street life, the history . . . Alas, you’re not the only person arriving in Paris – it pays to do some planning. In Paris, the quality of your experience can depend on the kind of ticket you have. Avoiding the crowds is good. Privileged access is good. Expert guides can reveal more than your guidebook could ever tell you. Sometimes, you discover that a nighttime or early-morning visit is quieter and more atmospheric. If you’re going to ‘do’ Paris, do it right. At the same time, remember there’s a whole other city waiting to be explored. In the laid-back districts of Belleville and Ménilmontant, you can tour the distinctive street art and learn more about such Parisian legends as Seth, Clet, Mesnager or Invader. A historical walk could introduce you to a bloodier history of massacres, executions, plague, torture and imprisonment. At the Fragonard Perfume Museum, you can create your own cologne. War enthusiasts, meanwhile, may be tempted to visit the nearby beaches of Normandy and see the D-Day battlefields first hand. The Dôme des Invalides allows the martial-minded to feast on the activities of Napoleon Bonaparte and explore one of the world’s greatest collections of antique arms and armor.",

From the Piazza Duomo, you can tour the colossal cathedral, the monumental Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, majestic La Scala and the old district of La Brera. Sforzesco Castle is a little further if you’d like to see the grandeur of Milan’s ruling dukes, while the city’s art galleries are a real treat for their permanent and ever-changing temporary exhibitions. If you need more labels in your life, take off the tracksuit and stroll the exclusive Via Monte Napoleone. Then, when you tire of past glories, go to the brand new Piazza Gae Aulenti to see the Unicredit Tower designed by architect César Pell. Beyond the city center, Milan’s districts offer different perspectives. Navigli is a cool network of canals whose bars and restaurants cast dancing reflections off the water at night. The previously blue-collar neighborhood of Isola has been reborn as a leafy oasis of notable street art, cafes, bars, boutiques, galleries and clubs – basically, hipster central. Citta Studi around Piazza Leonardo is where the students congregate, and therefore where you’ll find some good craft beers.
